                • Declare one string variable teamName.
                • Declare one int variable teamSize.
                • Declare one string array variable playerNames.
                • Declare one int array variable playerNumbers.

            Write a void method called getTeamInfo that does the following:
                • Ask the user to input the name of their team and assign that value to teamName.
                • Ask the user to input the size of their team and assign that value to teamSize.
                • Allocate enough memory for the playerNames array based on teamSize.
                • Allocate enough memory for the playerNumbers array based on teamSize.
                • Write a for loop that declares an int variable i to iterate teamSize times.
                • Within that loop, at each iteration:
                    o Ask the user for the current (i th) player’s name.
                    o Store the input value in the current (i th) position in the playerNames array.
                    o Ask the user for the current (i th) player’s number.
                    o Store the input value in the current (i th) position in the playerNumbers array.
            Write a void method called printTeamInfo that does the following:
                • Print the teamName to the screen.
                • Write a for loop that declares an int variable i to iterate teamSize times.
                • Within that loop, at each iteration:
                    o Print the the current (i th) player’s number to the screen.
                    o Print the the current (i th) player’s name to the screen.
                 Invoke getTeamInfo to create the team based on the user input.
                 Invoke printTeamInfo to display the full team information on the screen.
